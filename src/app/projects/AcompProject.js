    abstract: `What could possibly be the intention behind knowing the number of trees in an area? Be it Disaster Management, calculating the assets of the state, or under advanced circumstances, the ability to detect the quality of the trees, the Coconut Detection System is one to look into. <br><br>
    Using image processing to detect coconut trees from aerial views, is an innovative design which requires object detection models. During the development of the project, the members also developed a new object detection model – RetinaNet model. A combination of Focal Loss and ResNet, this new model surpassed the R-CNN model, while still being a stage one detector. <br><br>
    The final results of the project were accurate to a point where it could be deployed on a drone and be applied on live-feed. There is also further scope to better the model.

    abstract: `With technology developing, the health sector has been developing too. ReMedic is yet another step towards faster medical treatment to accident victims. It is an emergency service and aims at shortening the time by incorporating new-age technologies like drones and health monitoring sensors. <br><br>
    In case of an accident, the UID and GPS Coordinates call for the nearest hospital’s assistance by sending live data and feed using ML Algorithms. The case is then assigned to the available doctor. Machine Learning is used to analyse the patient’s condition and suggest solutions to the doctor. Medication is loaded into drones and sent to the accident site for initial treatment while the ambulance is sent to pick the victim up. <br><br>
    ReMedic aims at redefining and improving the emergency services and save lives.

Finding the route of a public transport and also making sure it does not cost much sure is a difficult task, which AutoBus is here to take care of. AutoBus is a mobile application developed to help you find the best option to travel based on pricing, route and traffic. <br><br>
    The application uses AudiQR and NFC to communicate with other AutoBus applications, keeping you away from the crowd. Equipped with the power of Machine Learning and Cloud, it makes commuting in public transport smooth and convenient.

    Developed for educational purposes and Cyber-Security awareness, the malware possesses spyware as well as remote payload execution capabilities. A demonstration of the same was also done in order to spread awareness.

    abstract: `Internet has become the way of life as of today, and no one is spared, be it 5 year old children or 50 year old adults. As the boons of internet shines brighter, the shadow of banes grows darker. It does not come off as a surprise that the websites which we regularly use are prone to vulgar and sexually explicit content which create huge negative impact on the brains of the users, especially children. <br><br>
    Here comes a solution for the above stated problem. The aim of this project is to censor the obscene and indecent images on a website. It is a plugin developed for accomplishing the same using neural networks. Once the extension is installed, all the images on a website accessed by the user will be processed and based on the extent of nudity depicted, images will be removed on the client side.
